# Stockbridge Cape Town Launch
Stockbridge Special Projects Lab sensor logging code designed for the Cape Town Launch in March of 2023.
This code is made for the xChips extended core module along with these xChips sensors:
- SGP30 (Gas, CO2, VOCT)
- LIS2DH12 (IMU, 3 Axis)
- SPL06-007 (Pressure, Altimeter)

NOTE: This code is different from the main branch! This is meant for the alternate xChips IMU!

This is what your hardware should look like if you are replicating this configuration.
